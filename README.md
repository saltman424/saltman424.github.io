# Hey there, I'm Sander Altman ðŸ‘‹

**Senior Full-Stack Engineer | AI Strategy Lead | Product-Minded Builder**

I build enterprise software that ships. Over the past 8 years, I've taken products from concept to production, leading teams and architecting solutions that scale.

## What I Do

I'm currently driving AI strategy and innovation initiatives, turning bleeding-edge LLM capabilities into practical, production-ready solutions. My sweet spot is at the intersection of deep technical execution and product strategyâ€”I don't just build features, I solve problems that matter.

### Technical Expertise

**Languages & Frameworks**
- TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js, Angular, Python
- GraphQL, REST, SQL, Java, C/C++

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
- AWS serverless (Lambda, DynamoDB, RDS, AppSync, Cognito, S3, CloudFront)
- Infrastructure-as-code (AWS CDK), CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture

**AI/ML**
- Amazon Bedrock, Microsoft 365 Agents SDK
- RAG, MCP, LangGraph, context engineering
- Production LLM integration and orchestration

### Leadership & Impact

Led the transformation from a feature-factory model to outcome-driven product development. Scaled technical leadership from individual contributor to managing 15+ developers and designers, while staying hands-on with architecture and code.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about building products where technical depth meets strategic thinking. I aim to foster environments where shipping matters; customers come first; and the best idea wins, regardless of who's in the room.
